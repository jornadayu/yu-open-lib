##### Versioning in documentation

Always add a `UNRELEASED` badge in the component/hook/helper/etc. story when creating a new one:

```tsx
import { BADGES } from '../../../.storybook/constants'

// src/stories/DialogTitle.stories.tsx
export default {
  title: 'Components/DialogTitle',
  component: DialogTitle,
  argTypes: { onClose: { action: 'onClose' } },
  parameters: {
    badges: [BADGES.UNRELEASED]
  }
} as ComponentMeta<typeof DialogTitle>
```

When a new release is made the unreleased badges will be automatically changed to the version being released.
