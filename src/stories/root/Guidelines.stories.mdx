## Stories

##### Versioning in documentation

Always add a badge with the version the component/hook/helper/etc. was added. Example:

```tsx
// src/stories/DialogTitle.stories.tsx
export default {
  title: 'Components/DialogTitle',
  component: DialogTitle,
  argTypes: { onClose: { action: 'onClose' } },
  parameters: {
    badges: ['Added: 1.7.9'] // Component was added in version 1.7.9
  }
} as ComponentMeta<typeof DialogTitle>
```

If a release is not being made in the same Pull Request as the story being added, then use the `BADGES.UNRELEASED` badge. Example:

```tsx
// src/stories/DialogTitle.stories.tsx
import { BADGES } from '../../.storybook/constants'

export default {
  title: 'Components/DialogTitle',
  component: DialogTitle,
  argTypes: { onClose: { action: 'onClose' } },
  parameters: {
    badges: [BADGES.UNRELEASED] // Component was still not released
  }
} as ComponentMeta<typeof DialogTitle>
```

On release pull requests (ex.: `release/v1.7.9`), all stories with a unreleased badge should then be changed to contain a badge with the format `Added: x.y.z`, where `x.y.z` stands for the exact version for the release being made.
